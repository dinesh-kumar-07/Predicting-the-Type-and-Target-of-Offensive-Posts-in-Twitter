# Predicting-the-Type-and-Target-of-Offensive-Posts-in-Twitter


In this project, we have proposed a meta-learning approach for text classification using a combination of a base model and a meta-learner model. The base model, based on the BERT architecture, is used to extract contextualized representations of text, while the meta-learner model leverages these representations to make predictions for the target task.
